# Getting started

In order to get started with Sorbay and running your own service,
a workspace must be created first. During your first log in to
the Sorbay platform, you will be asked to provide the name for
the first workspace to be created, which will then allow you to
use it to create service.

## Navigation

On the left side you find the main navigation menu. It provides
the following options:

* Workspace selector - shows the currently selected workspace
* Start - Changes back to the start page that is also presented
  to the user after logging in.
* Services - Opens the [services page](services.md) which allows to create,
  change and delete services.
* Members - Opens the [members page](members.md) where you can add or remove
  members for the currently selected workspace.
* Settings - Opens the workspace [settings page](settings.md).


## Basic Workflow

* Select the workspace you want to create services in with the
  workspace selection in the top-most navigation entry.
* Create and / or change services in the currently selected
  workspace by clicking the "Services" option in the navigation.
* Add more users to become members of this workspace by selecting
  the "Members" menu option in the navigation.
* Change the settings of the currently selected workspace by
  selecting the "Settings" option in the navigation.
