This page allows to 

* change workspace settings
* add or remove workspace members 
* delete the currently selected workspace

## Change workspace name

Change the name of the currently selected workspace by entering any name here:

<img style="margin-left: 80px; width: 75%; border: 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: lightgray" src="../img/settings_general.png">

## Leave workspace

You can leave the workspace, so as to no longer be a member and/or administrator
of it:

<img style="margin-left: 80px; width: 75%; border: 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: lightgray" src="../img/settings_leave-workspace.png">

However, in case your account is currently the only administrator for the workspace,
you need to first [add another member](members.md) with the role "Workspace admin".

## Delete workspace

Finally you can delete the currently selected workspace:

<img style="margin-left: 80px; width: 75%; border: 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: lightgray" src="../img/settings_delete-workspace.png">

Click the "Delete workspace" button and confirm the deletion by clicking "Yes" in the
confirmation pop up dialogue to delete the workspace and *irrevocably remove all its 
associated services and resources*.
