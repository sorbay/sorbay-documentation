On the profile page, you can change all the settings related to your
personal user profile.

To open the profile page, click the "Profile" option on the selector in the upper right corner:

<img style="margin-left: 80px; width: 35%; border: 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: lightgray" src="../img/profile_selector_open.png">

## Email verification

In case your email address has not been verified yet, you will be shown a notification message
at the top of the screen which indicates that you can re-send the email with the verification
link. Click this link to receive another email and then click the link in that mail to verify
your mail address.

## Profile settings

In the "Profile" section, you can set or change the following attributes:

* First name
* Last name
* Username
* Email address
* Preferred language

Press the "Save" button in the lower right corner to apply and save the changes.

## Password

To change your password, click the "Change Password" button in the "Password" section:

<img style="margin-left: 80px; width: 35%; border: 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: lightgray" src="../img/profile_change_password.png">

This will open a popup dialogue, where you can enter the new password string:

<img style="margin-left: 80px; width: 75%; border: 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: lightgray" src="../img/profile_change_password_confirm.png">

Apply and save the new password by clicking the "Submit" button.

### Security

For increased account security, it is recommended to enable two-factor authentication, using
the widely available "Google Authenticator" app (iOS, Android). To enable it for your account,
click on the "Two-Factor Authentication" button, which opens this dialog with a QR code:

<img style="margin-left: 80px; width: 45%; border: 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: lightgray" src="../img/profile_totp_qr_code.png">

Open your Authenticator app on your iOS or Android device, and scan the QR code. This will create
a new entry in your Authenticator app under the label "sorbay". 
Then continue to the next dialogue, where you will have to enter the code currently displayed in 
the Authenticator app, to confirm that the QR code was correctly processed:

<img style="margin-left: 80px; width: 35%; border: 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: lightgray" src="../img/profile_totp_verification_code.png">

Finally, another dialogue will provide a download for backup recovery codes, that you can use to 
recover your account in case your iOS or Android device gets lost, stolen or damaged, and you cannot
use the Authenticator app anymore.

<img style="margin-left: 80px; width: 75%; border: 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: lightgray" src="../img/profile_totp_recovery_codes.png">

Download the recovery codes by clicking the "Backup recovery codes" button, and then "Confirm download".

Congratulations, you have now enabled two-factor authentication. The "Security" section in the 
profile page now looks like this:

<img style="margin-left: 80px; width: 75%; border: 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: lightgray" src="../img/profile_security_section_totp_enabled.png">

* Click "Disable two factor authentication" to switch back to logging in with password-only
* Click "Download recovery codes" to re-download your recovery codes
* Click "Reset recovery codes" to create a new set of recovery codes

## Account deletion

You can remove your account completely in the last section at the 
bottom of the screen, under "Account deletion".

NOTE: This action will irretrievably remove your user account
and all corresponding data, and cannot be undone!
