This page allows you to create, change and remove workspace members.

* You can search for one or multiple users by using the "Filter" input field, where
  you can enter a full or partial name.

The page shows you a list of all members of the currently selected workspace,
based on the currently set filter. If no filter is set, all users are listed.

## Adding new members

To add one or multiple new members, click the "Add Member" button in the
lower right corner. It will open this dialog:

In the "Email or username" input field, you can enter one or multiple
email addresses or usernames.

NOTE: Please ensure that the user accounts for the usernames or email
addresses entered here have already been registered in Sorbay.

With the drop-down list below, select the role for the new member(s):

* Workspace admin: The user can administrate workspaces, i.e. change workspace
  settings, create new workspaces, and delete them.
* Service admin: The user can create, change and remove services.

Click the "Send invitation" button to trigger a mail with an invitation link being
