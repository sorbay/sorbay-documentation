This page allows you to create, change and remove services.

For the duration of the beta test, only 1 service is available.
More services will be added and made available once the sorbay
platform is officially released.

## Create a new service

To create a new service, click the "Create" button in the lower right corner:

<img style="margin-left: 80px; width: 20%; border: 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: lightgray" src="../img/services_button_create.png">

A dialog will pop up with an input field, where you are asked to
enter the name of the service:

<img style="margin-left: 80px; width: 75%; border: 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: lightgray" src="../img/services_create_popup.png">

Once you have created one or more services, you will see this list of services available in the current workspace:

<img style="margin-left: 80px; width: 85%; border: 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: lightgray" src="../img/services_list.png">

### Using a service

In order to configure a newly created service, click the "Service settings" button in the "..."-popup dialog:

<img style="margin-left: 80px; width: 35%; border: 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: lightgray" src="../img/services_service_details_popup.png">

This will open the settings page for that service instance, with the "General" tab selected:

<img style="margin-left: 80px; width: 75%; border: 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: lightgray" src="../img/sorbay_ciam_settings_general.png">
